Woke up with a wound, finding myself on the side of the street. 
Partners' corpse lying around. Slaughtered.
10 bandits are trying to open the caravan, looking for the remaining goods. Could try to grab the sword and fight back. Or keep lying waiting for them to leave. 
What should I do? 
1. Grab the sword and try to fight back!
2. Wait for the bandits to leave!
